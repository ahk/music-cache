MusicCache

You have a lot of music files (mp3 support only for now). You want to know what you have, where you have it, and what shape it's in (duplicates, encodings, size, track completion, mislabelings).

You'd also like to be able to query this data, for use in other programs â€“ say a web based music player like FTANG (http://github.com/maxogden/ftang).

You could use MusicCache to do these things!

Music cache is written in ruby, and stores in Redis. 

it is executed by:
music-cache scan mp3_folder
e.g.
music-cache scan /home/YourUser/Music
